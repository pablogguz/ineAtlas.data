## Data repository for the `ineAtlas` R package

This is the data repository accompanying the [`ineAtlas`](https://github.com/pablogguz/ineAtlas) R package. It contains processed and standardized data from the Spanish Statistical Office _(INE)_ [_Atlas de Distribución de Renta de los Hogares_](https://www.ine.es/dyngs/INEbase/es/operacion.htm?c=Estadistica_Candcid=1254736177088andmenu=ultiDatosandidp=1254735976608) (Household Income Distribution Atlas), providing detailed socioeconomic indicators at multiple geographic levels in Spain. The repository also includes boundary files for census tracts.

## Data source

The data comes from Spanish Statistical Office's Household Income Distribution Atlas, which combines administrative tax data with population statistics to provide detailed information about income distribution and related socioeconomic indicators across the country.

## Geographic levels

Data is available at three geographic levels:

- Municipality _(Municipio)_
- District _(Distrito)_
- Census tract _(Sección censal)_

## Available datasets

The repository contains the following datasets:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
datasets <- data.frame(
  Dataset = c("Income", "Income sources", "Demographics", 
              "Distribution by sex", "Distribution by sex and age",
              "Distribution by sex and nationality", "Inequality indicators",
              "Census tract geometries"),
  Description = c(
    "Income indicators including net/gross income per capita and household income",
    "Income distribution by source (wages, pensions, benefits, etc.)",
    "Population characteristics including age structure and household composition",
    "Income distribution indicators disaggregated by sex",
    "Income distribution indicators by sex and age groups",
    "Income distribution indicators by sex and nationality status",
    "Inequality metrics including Gini coefficient and P80/P20 ratio",
    "Census tract boundary files (2015-2022)"
  ),
  Files = c(
    "income_*.csv",
    "income_sources_*.csv",
    "demographics_*.csv",
    "distribution_sex_*.csv",
    "distribution_sex_age_*.csv",
    "distribution_sex_nationality_*.csv",
    "gini_p80p20_*.csv",
    "census_tracts_*.gpkg.zip"
  )
)

knitr::kable(datasets)
```

## Usage with `ineAtlas` package

While this data can be used independently, it's designed to work seamlessly with the [`ineAtlas`](https://github.com/pablogguz/ineAtlas) R package, which provides functions for easily accessing the data:

```r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("pablogguz/ineAtlas")

library(ineAtlas)
```

See the [`ineAtlas`](https://github.com/pablogguz/ineAtlas) package documentation for complete usage instructions and examples.

## Updates

The data in this repository is automatically updated when new releases of the Atlas de Distribución de Renta de los Hogares are published by INE. Updates are processed using the pipeline in the main [`ineAtlas`](https://github.com/pablogguz/ineAtlas) repository.
